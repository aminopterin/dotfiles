This repo backs up configuration files I use personally.

## My `.vimrc`

The `.vimrc` is a plain text file that holds desired settings to be initialized in Vim. (Here `rc` means "run commands", a phrase originated in Unix-like systems.) It specifies read-and-write settings, search-and-replace options, self-defined shortcuts, user-implemented functions, and more. If saved in the current user's home, it is read in runtime, and applied by, Vim.

## My `.bashrc` and `.bash_profile`

The `.bash_profile` consists only one line, namely one that sources `.bashrc` if the latter exists.

The `.bashrc` includes all my custom appearances, shortcuts, functions, variables, and more, for the Bash shell.

## My `.tmux.conf`

Configuration file for Tmux.

## My `.gitconfig`

Configuration file for Git.

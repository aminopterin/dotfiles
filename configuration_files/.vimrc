" Date: mostly Oct. 2016 to Jan. 2017
" Author: Aminopterin (Tzu-Yu Jeng)
" Description: Settings and custom commands for Vim.
" Requirement: That this be saved in the home.
"
" " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " "
"
"    It's mainly based on Amir Salihefendic's `.vimrc` (`github.com/amix/vimrc`).
" Also influenced by various Stack Overflow and Vim Stack Exchange posts. Excuse
" me for not attributing each one of them, but my gratitude is genuine.
"    Legend for keys: `<cr>` for the return key, `<esc>` the escape key, <bs>
" for the backspace, <space> for the spacebar, and `<c-*>` for `<ctrl>*` 
" (holding `<ctrl>` while pressing * where * is some key). Though abbreviations
" exist, I shall use the full name form whenever possble, for ease of reading.
"
" " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " "
"
"    From now on, I'll classify settings in the manner of a GUI toolbar.
